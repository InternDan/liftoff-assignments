## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This website is an extension of a mobile application that I've already developed, but can also function as a stand-alone site. It is intended to provide an easy to use interface for personal trainers and their trainees to share video links and other information back and forth in a private fashion, so that only trainers and trainees can see videos of people doing exercises. It is primarily aimed at tele-coaches and their trainees, but can also be useful for people who interact in the same local space.

User profiles that provide basic information for trainers and trainees to interact more productively.
